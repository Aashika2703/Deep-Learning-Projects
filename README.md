# Deep-Learning using Python
The above dataset is about setting up a Convolutional Neural Network with Prediction in the end via Images as input.

# DLNLP Term Projects #
### 1. The first project incorporates Vehicle security system using facial recognition ###
CNN algorithm is used to calculate the results

### 2. The second project incorporates Stock Price prediction for Microsoft ###
LSTM is used here as it is a time series model. Aspects of RNN are explored and the ARIMA Model is also used.
